# How does it work?
All you have to do to run Cosmic Mind is to download Python and necessary libraries and then run gui.py file.

- To install libraries, you can basically run this command in the root directory:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- After the first step, please run the gui.py file with the following command:
`python3 gui.py`
